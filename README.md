## Functionalities

- **Reusable Docker Environment**: Quickly spin up containers for Python projects with predefined configurations.
- **Isolated Python Environment**: Run applications without worrying about conflicts with local environments or dependencies.
- **Lightweight Setup**: Efficient and fast to build.
- **Customizable**: Adjust the `Dockerfile` and requirements to fit any Python project.

## Requirements

To use this repository, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- **Docker**: Install from Docker website.
- Optionally, **Git** for version control and collaboration.

## How to Use

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine or server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samueldata/my-docker-repo.git
cd my-docker-repo
```

### 2. Build the Docker image

Navigate to the repository folder and build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t my-python-app .
```

### 3. Run the container

Once the image is built, run the container with:

```bash
docker run -it --name my-running-app my-python-app
```

This will start a Python environment running inside the Docker container.

### 4. Modify `Dockerfile` and add your project

If you want to run your own Python application, just place your Python files in the `app/` directory and update `requirements.txt` accordingly.

The repository comes with a basic Python app (`main.py`), which you can replace with your own project.

### 5. Stopping the Container

You can stop the running container using:

```bash
docker stop my-running-app
```

### Customization

- **Dockerfile**: Modify the `Dockerfile` to install other dependencies or configure specific Python versions.
- **requirements.txt**: Add your Python package dependencies here.

## Benefits

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works the same on any OS with Docker.
- **Efficient Development**: Avoids issues with local setups; develop and test in isolated containers.
- **Easy Collaboration**: Share the container setup with team members, ensuring everyone works in the same environment.
